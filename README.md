# Terraform AWS EKS Cluster Project

## Overview
This project, **TerraEKS**, provides Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to deploy a production-ready Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. The infrastructure includes:

- A properly configured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs).
- Security groups for secure networking.
- Auto-scaling node groups.
- IAM roles and policies following the principle of least privilege.

## Features
- Highly available EKS cluster across multiple AZs.
- Secure networking with public subnets for worker nodes.
- IAM configurations with least privilege.
- Fully customizable using variables.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following before starting:

1. AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate IAM permissions.
2. Terraform installed (version >= 1.0.0).
3. AWS account with permissions to manage EKS, IAM, and VPC resources.
4. Chocolatey package manager (optional, for updating Terraform).

---

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArashMHD91/Terraform-AWS-EKS-cluster.git
   cd Terraform-AWS-EKS-cluster
   ```

2. Ensure your Terraform version is up to date:
   ```bash
   terraform version
   ```
   If outdated, update using Chocolatey (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   choco install terraform --pre
   ```

3. Export your AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<your-access-key-id>"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<your-secret-access-key>"
   ```

4. Verify your IAM role permissions to ensure you can apply the configurations.

---

## Configuration
Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to customize your setup:
```hcl
aws_region          = "us-west-2"
cluster_name        = "my-eks-cluster"
environment         = "development"
kubernetes_version  = "1.27"
desired_nodes       = 2
min_nodes           = 1
max_nodes           = 4
vpc_cidr_block      = "10.0.0.0/16"
subnet_cidr_blocks  = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
node_instance_types = ["t3.medium"]
```

---

## Deployment Steps
1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

2. Validate the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

3. Plan the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
   Review the execution plan to confirm the resources to be created.

4. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
   Type `yes` when prompted to confirm.

5. Navigate to the [Amazon EKS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home) to review the cluster's status and configuration.

---

## Outputs
After successful deployment, Terraform provides the following outputs:

- **EKS Cluster Name**: Name of the created EKS cluster.
- **Cluster Endpoint**: Endpoint URL for the EKS cluster.
- **Cluster ARN**: Amazon Resource Name of the EKS cluster.
- **Cluster Security Group ID**: Security group ID associated with the cluster.
- **Node Group ARN**: ARN of the EKS node group.
- **VPC ID**: ID of the created VPC.

---

## Clean Up
To avoid unnecessary charges, destroy the resources when they are no longer needed:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
Type `yes` to confirm.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If Terraform commands fail, check your IAM permissions and ensure the AWS credentials are correctly exported.
- Ensure your Terraform and AWS CLI versions are up to date.
- Refer to the Terraform documentation for [EKS](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/eks_cluster).

---

## Security Best Practices
- Use least privilege IAM roles and policies.
- Limit public access to resources unless necessary.
- Use encrypted secrets and credentials for authentication.
